This game was written in Java using the NetBeans IDE with the JBox2D engine. In this video game platform, the player can run, jump and fire in order to stop the enemies. There are three stages and the main goal of the hero is to collect all the Pokeballs without losing all of his life points. In other words, it is very similar to the well-known Super Mario video game.

Do not forget to add the libraries before to start the game (use the folder "Libraries")!
