# MilestoneGame-Project
The game was written in Java by using NetBeans IDE with the JBox2D engine. As in platform video games, the player runs, jumps and fires across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels (3 stages). The main goal of the game is to collect all the Pokeballs.

Do not forget to add the libraries before to start the game (use the folder "Libraries")! Check here how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqhQY7U9Rlc&feature=youtu.be
